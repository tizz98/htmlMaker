# HTML Maker

Html Maker is a simple c++ program that will generate an html file based on your input for either html 4 or html 5.
It will also ask what you want to call your webpage. (the "title")

Created by Elijah Wilson. 2013.

## To Run:

* Compile htmlMaker.cxx (you can use the option '-o <filename>' when you compile to make the executable a certain name if you want)
* Run whatever you called the executable (./<filename>) by default it is "a.out" so you would type "./a.out"

And you're done!
